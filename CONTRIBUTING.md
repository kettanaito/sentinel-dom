# Contributing
## Foreword
First of all, let me thank you for deciding to contribute to Sentinel DOM!

## Guidelines
Please follow the next guidelines when contributing to the library:
* Follow the [Git workflow](#git-workflow)
* Keep your code clean and simple
* Last but not least, do not forget about being polite on the web

## Git workflow
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch with the prefix `bug` when submitting a bugfix, or `feature` when submitting a new feature. The branch name should look like this: `feature/auto-tracking`.
3. Implement your changes.
4. Rebase your branch relatively to the current `master` in the *original* repository.
4. Create a new pull request in your fork repository. Select an original repository as a target branch.
5. Await a code review and provide the changes to the code, when necessary.
